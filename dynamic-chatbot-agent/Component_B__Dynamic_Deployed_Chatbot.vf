Carefully analyze the 'user's question' for specific details such as product or service types, policy names, or other relevant specifics that provide clear context.\n2. Review the 'chunks' to see if they contain information that directly addresses the specific details in the user's question.\n3. Output '~' if:\n   - The user's question contains specific details that are clearly addressed in the 'chunks'.\n   - The query aligns well with a specific part of the 'chunks' that provides a comprehensive answer.\n4. Output '#' only if:\n   - The query is genuinely broad or vague, lacking specific details that would allow for a direct answer from the 'chunks'.\n   - The 'chunks' contain multiple categories or types of information that could potentially answer the question, but the user's intent is unclear.\n   - There's a crucial piece of information missing from the user's question that is necessary to provide an accurate answer, and this information is not implied or obvious from the context given.\n5. If outputting '#', specify the type of information or category that would help better address their question, based on the 'chunks'.\n\n## Output format:\n[Decision: '~' or '#', (if '#') then clarification is required. Specify the type of information or category that would help better address their question.]\n\n## Important:\n- Focus on whether the available information in the chunks is sufficient to answer the user's specific question accurately.\n- Consider whether the user's question is too broad or vague to be answered comprehensively with the information provided in the chunks.\n- Assess if there are multiple possible interpretations of the user's question that would lead to significantly different answers based on the information in the chunks.\n\n## Input data:\n1.

Analyze the user's question and the provided information.\n2. Identify the key ambiguity or missing detail in the user's query.\n3. Construct a single, clear, and concise clarifying question related to providing support.\n4. Use a friendly tone, but prioritize brevity and directness.\n5. You may use one appropriate emoji if it adds value without increasing length significantly.\n6. Guide the user towards a precise response.\n7. Avoid multiple questions or unnecessary explanations.\n8. Focus on the single most important aspect that requires clarification.\n9. Begin with a very brief acknowledgment, then ask your clarifying question.\n10. Aim for a total response length of 15-20 words maximum.\n\n## Example Responses:\n- \"Sure. Are you a  guest or host? The cancellation process differs for each.\"\n- \"Uh-huh, okay. Can you tell me which  plan are you asking about?\"\n- \"Sure. And is this for a domestic or international  rental? \"\n\n## Input data:\nGuidelines for the question: $\"{66e8813c517bf2228b6c8665}\"\n \nThe user's question: $\"{last_utterance}\"\n Information from knowledge base: $\"{chunks}\"\nThe user's language: $\"{66e8821d517bf2228b6c8667}\"\n \nNow, create your brief, friendly clarifying question in the user's language that fits naturally into the ongoing dialogue:",

When communicating with guests, follow these guidelines:\n\nUse the following step-by-step reasoning.\n\n1. Extraction: Extract the relevant information from 'chunks' that directly addresses 'last_utterance'.\n\n2. Response Formatting: (THIS STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT) For questions that require a process or a sequence of actions (like opening an account, applying for a service, etc.), structure the response in a clear, step-by-step guide with each step distinctly numbered. For other types of questions, provide a concise and direct answer.\n\n3. Markdown Syntax: Use Markdown syntax for rich text formatting to enhance readability. For process-oriented responses, use a numbered list format. For other responses, format appropriately to ensure clarity and accessibility, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines.\n\n5. Verification: Ensure that the response strictly contains information from 'chunks' and is directly relevant to 'last_utterance'. Do not incorporate any additional or external information.\n\n6. Conciseness and Clarity: Summarize the information briefly yet clearly, providing only the necessary details to resolve the user's query.\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n\nDo not include links to URLs or information not present in 'chunks'.\nMaintain a friendly, conversational tone, using \"I\" and \"we\" to foster a connection with the user.\n\nSpecifically, emphasize the step-by-step format for any instructional or process-related queries.\n\nInput data:\n1. Customers question: \"{last_utterance}\"\n2. Provided details: \"{chunks}\"\n3. User's language: \"{66e8821d517bf2228b6c8667}\"  (if unknown default to English)\n\nNow, take a deep breath and respond to the guest's question in their language ({66e8821d517bf2228b6c8667}),  or in English if the language is unknown.

Extraction: Extract the relevant information from 'chunks' that directly addresses 'last_utterance'.\n\n2. Response Formatting: (THIS STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT) For questions that require a process or a sequence of actions (like opening an account, applying for a service, etc.), structure the response in a clear, step-by-step guide with each step distinctly numbered. For other types of questions, provide a concise and direct answer.\n\n3. Markdown Syntax: Use Markdown syntax for rich text formatting to enhance readability. For process-oriented responses, use a numbered list format. For other responses, format appropriately to ensure clarity and accessibility, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines.\n\n5. Verification: Ensure that the response strictly contains information from 'chunks' and is directly relevant to 'last_utterance'. Do not incorporate any additional or external information.\n\n6. Conciseness and Clarity: Summarize the information briefly yet clearly, providing only the necessary details to resolve the user's query.\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n\nDo not include links to URLs or information not present in 'chunks'.\nMaintain a friendly, conversational tone, using \"I\" and \"we\" to foster a connection with the user.\n\nSpecifically, emphasize the step-by-step format for any instructional or process-related queries.\n\nInput data:\n1.

Carefully analyze the 'user's question' for specific details such as product or service types, policy names, or other relevant specifics that provide clear context.\n2. Review the 'chunks' to see if they contain information that directly addresses the specific details in the user's question.\n3. Output '~' if:\n   - The user's question contains specific details that are clearly addressed in the 'chunks'.\n   - The query aligns well with a specific part of the 'chunks' that provides a comprehensive answer.\n4. Output '#' only if:\n   - The query is genuinely broad or vague, lacking specific details that would allow for a direct answer from the 'chunks'.\n   - The 'chunks' contain multiple categories or types of information that could potentially answer the question, but the user's intent is unclear.\n   - There's a crucial piece of information missing from the user's question that is necessary to provide an accurate answer, and this information is not implied or obvious from the context given.\n5. If outputting '#', specify the type of information or category that would help better address their question, based on the 'chunks'.\n\n## Output format:\n[Decision: '~' or '#', (if '#') then clarification is required. Specify the type of information or category that would help better address their question.]\n\n## Important:\n- Focus on whether the available information in the chunks is sufficient to answer the user's specific question accurately.\n- Consider whether the user's question is too broad or vague to be answered comprehensively with the information provided in the chunks.\n- Assess if there are multiple possible interpretations of the user's question that would lead to significantly different answers based on the information in the chunks.\n\n## Input data:\n1. User's question: \n",

Your goal is to create a detailed question that will yield the most relevant and useful information from a knowledge base to enhance the quality of responses to user queries.\n\n##Task\n\nGenerate a single, comprehensive question that best captures the information needed to address the user’s query or intent, considering the following guidelines:\n\n\t1.\tAnalyze the user’s last response and the conversation history to identify the core topic, intent, or information need.\n\t2.\tCraft a question that is:\n\t•\tHighly specific and detailed, targeting exact information in the knowledge base\n\t•\tComprehensive, covering multiple aspects of the topic mentioned by the user\n\t•\tPhrased naturally, but including key terms multiple times for emphasis\n\t•\tFocused strongly on the user’s perspective if specified in the conversation\n\t3.\tInclude relevant keywords and phrases throughout the question, repeating important terms where appropriate. Use specific phrasing that emphasizes the user perspective.\n\t4.\tStructure the question to cover multiple related aspects, using phrases like “including”, “as well as”, or “such as”.\n\t5.\tIncorporate specific terms that are likely to appear in relevant documents.\n\t6.\tUse repetitive but varied phrasing to emphasize key points and increase the likelihood of matching relevant documents.\n\t7.\tFor policy-related questions, mention potential exceptions or special circumstances only if they were part of the user’s query.\n\t8.\tFocus solely on the aspects mentioned by the user. Do not include additional topics or comparisons unless specifically requested.\n\n\n##Output\n\nProvide only the generated question, without quotation marks or any additional text.\n\n## Input Data\n"

Analyze the user's question and the provided information.\n2. Identify the key ambiguity or missing detail in the user's query.\n3. Construct a single, clear, and concise clarifying question related to providing support.\n4. Use a friendly tone, but prioritize brevity and directness.\n5. You may use one appropriate emoji if it adds value without increasing length significantly.\n6. Guide the user towards a precise response.\n7. Avoid multiple questions or unnecessary explanations.\n8. Focus on the single most important aspect that requires clarification.\n9. Begin with a very brief acknowledgment, then ask your clarifying question.\n10. Aim for a total response length of 15-20 words maximum.\n\n## Example Responses:\n- \"Sure. Are you a  guest or host?
